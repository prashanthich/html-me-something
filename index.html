                    <p>Spiced Potatoes with Cauliflower. This Aloo Gobi is packed with flavors, super comforting, vegan and simply the best aloo gobi you will ever have!</p>
                    <p>Aloo gobi (potatoes & cauliflower) is a popular Indian dish in which potatoes and cauliflower are cooked with onions, tomatoes and spices. This dish can be made in several ways, you can make it with only onions or only tomatoes or use no onion-tomato at all. I also make it in different ways depending on what ingredients I have on hand, the aloo gobi recipe that I am sharing today is one of my favorite versions. It has onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic and yes spices!</p>

					<h2>Chicken-65</h2>
					<p>I always associate Chicken 65 with Madurai although I have only been to Madurai once and I didn’t eat Chicken 65 during that trip. Weird, I know, but not too much because Chicken 65 is a very popular and spicy street food in Madurai. Anyway, I am sure none of you are new to this deliciously spicy fried chicken dish from South India that serves as an appetizer as well as it does a main dish. Now, the Chicken 65 in roadside stalls and restaurants may look a bit different but that’s because they add a large pinch of red food colour and I didn’t. But I can assure you that these bite-sized pieces of chicken are crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and adequately spiced up.</p>

                    <p>You know the most famous Indian food in the world? It’s Chicken Tikka Masala, at least that’s what I have read. You talk to anyone in UK, USA even if they wouldn’t know much about Indian food they would definitely know about chicken tikka masala. I think the dish is synonyms with Indian food in the west.</p>

					<h2>Palak Paneer</h2>
                    <p>When we were kids, the only way my brothers would eat spinach was if it was cooked with paneer in palak paneer.</p>
                    <p>It was such a great way to sneak in the greens. They wouldn’t touch spinach otherwise but if there was paneer with it, they would happily gulp down bowls of it.</p>
                    <p>Palak Paneer is such a staple in north India. It’s one of the most commonly made paneer dishes in Indian homes.</p>

					<h2>Okra Fry</h2>
					<p>Minimal spices and clean flavors are the key factors that make today’s dish an all time favorite in our home. Okra aka Bhindi aka Bendakaya is a much cherished Indian vegetable in our home and we enjoy it in all its avatars.</p>
					<p>A few days ago, I made an Okra fry to go with rotis. Its a slightly different version of the okra fry recipe I blogged earlier. I tend to go back to this Andhra style okra fry recipe often because of its simplicity and tantalizing flavors. The tempering ingredients along with the roasting of the okra yield an incredible flavor. Do try this Indian vegetable recipe which makes for a delectable side with rice and sambar or pappu pulusu and rotis. Left overs make a delicious filling for a sandwich.</p>
